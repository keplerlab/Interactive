<h4>How about a Chrome Browser Extension to measure the Page load performance and other details to analyse the load time of your web page ? </h4>

<li>Also captures all JS/CSS and Image load times and provides data on whether they are internal/ external or sub domain files.</li>
<li>Managers/BA/Clients can easily see the page load time without much technical knowledge and using this extension is a cake walk</li>
<li>Built on top of HTML5 window.performance and native Javascript</li>
</ul>
