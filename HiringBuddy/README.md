Hiring Buddy
=======

Set of tools that will help automae the laborious processes involved in hiring. The suite will include tools for Interviewees, Interviewers and HR coordinators.

I have started working on an Electon App for the interviewees. 


Kindly donot Judge the quality of the app based on the UX. I am not a UX guy and will need UX help to revamp and make this better.

Here is the total plan. More like my notes. Will try and update it to meaningful information as and when I find time.

For Interviewees:

Fullscreen mode
Disable minimize, window access amongst other features. No way to acess any other software apart from the one running
No access to dev tools
DB pool of questions
Weight for each question

For Interviewers
Score sheet with weak and strong areas based on scores
Interactive ui to input candidate information

For HR Coordinators:

Aptitude -
Ability to set minimum percentage criteria
Ability to rank the candidates and process their resume's based on scores ( Direct DI, Pre screen for DI or Reject )
Notify wait time to candidates => based on average interview time(configurable)

Pre screening and Domain Interview -
Ability to allocate the candidates to Interviewers

Domian Interview -
Live view of candidats performance updates and final decission. 
Access to selection and rejection data at any time.

Export to excel any required information


Tech stack :

For interview app : Electorn based App build using vanilla js or jQuery using a common backend.
For interviewer and HR app : React app using Sails backend and Redis DB.
